Autosysadmin "restart auto" scripts
===================================

In this directory you can place scripts that will be executed automatically by a cron job (stored in `/etc/cron.d/autosysadmin`).

They must satisfy the default `run-parts(8)` constaints :

* be "executable"
* belong to the Debian cron script namespace (`^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$`), example: `restart_amavis`

Warning: scripts that do not satisfy those criteria will NOT be run (silently)!

You can print the names of the scripts which would be run, without actually running them, with this command :

```
$ run-parts --test /usr/share/scripts/autosysadmin/restart
```

You can use `zzz-restart_example.template` as boilerplate code to make your own "restart" script.
